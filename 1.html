<h1>Web developer</h1>
<p>
A <strong><u>Web</u> developer</strong> is a programmer or a coder who develops World Wide Web applications using a clientâ€“server model.
</p>
<p style="margin-top:45px">
The applications typically use HTML, CSS and JavaScript in the client, PHP, ASP.NET (C#), Python, Node.js, Go or Java in the server, and http for communications between client and server.<br>
A web developer may specialize in client-side applications (front-end developer), server-side applications (back-end developer), or both (full-stack developer).<br>
A web content management system may be used to develop and maintain web applications.
